# U21566641.github.io

-This is a basic portfolio website for the INF272 module at the University of Pretoria

-My aims when making this website were to:
 a. Present myself to the lecturing team
 b. Create a legible but basic website

-This website is in no way indicative of my web design/development skills as I assumed that it was solely meant to familiarize the students with github, and thus not much time has been dedicated to it.

-A free bootstrap template was utilized and edited for the purposes of this assignment.
